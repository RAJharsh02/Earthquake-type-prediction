Approach for this Project:The project aimed to predict whether a given earthquake is detected by automatic detection systems using Deep learning models. The dataset was loaded and explored to gain insights into the data, followed by preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling. Three models were developed: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN),Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNNs), and Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU). Each model was trained and evaluated based on accuracy.
